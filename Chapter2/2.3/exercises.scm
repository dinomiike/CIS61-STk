;; element-of-set? is a predicate that determines whether a given element is a member of a set
;; adjoin-set takes an object and a set as arguments and returns a set that contains the elements of the original set and also the adjoined element
;; union-set computers the union of two sets, which is the set containing each element that appears in either argument
;; intersection-set computes the intersection of two sets, which is the set containing only elements that appear in both arguments
