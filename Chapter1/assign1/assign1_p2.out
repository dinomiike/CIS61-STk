;; Problem 2:
What is (first (butfirst ''''quote))? Why?

The expression is evaluated as:
STk> (first (bf ''''quote))
(quote (quote quote))

Quote is used to evaluate the argument as a literal term.
Quote (or ') is required to use the word "quote" in your expression without the interpreter evaluating it,
like using quotation marks around a word or phrase to translate their literal meaning.

''''quote returns:
(quote (quote (quote (quote quote))))

(bf ''''quote) will return:
((quote (quote quote)))
Which is all but the first (quote) in the prior expression.

Therefore, the result of the problem expression:
(quote (quote quote))
is the result of pulling the first item from the list of nested quotes.
